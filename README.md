👋 Hi, I'm @hibyrk

I'm a 16-year-old high school student from Turkey, and I just started learning to code.  
Currently focused on **JavaScript** and the fundamentals of web development.

## 🚀 My Goal
Build a strong foundation step by step and create simple but real projects as I learn.

## 📚 What I'm Learning Now
- JavaScript (core concepts, functions, logic)
- HTML & CSS (basic structure and styling)
- Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)

## 🛠️ Tools I'm Using
- Visual Studio Code  
- GitHub  
- Live Server extension

## 📅 Learning Progress
I'll be updating this profile as I build and upload projects along the way.  
I'm not in a rush — just aiming for consistency.
